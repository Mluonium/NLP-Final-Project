(find out about hyperparameters)
1. Train both models - one on English and one on Russian.
2. Test both models on a Serbian dataset.
3. Evaluate the performance using the Span F1.
4. Compare the metrics and interpret the results.
5. (Maybe?) Choose other two languages and run the experiment again.
6. Write the report.
